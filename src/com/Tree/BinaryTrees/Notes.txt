TREES
• Represent hierarchical data
• Databases
• Autocompletion
• compilers
• compression

• NON - LINEAR DATA STRUCTURES
  • Binary Trees
  • AVL Trees
  • Heaps
  • Tries
  • Graphs

A tree is a data structure that stores elements in a hierarchy
we refer to these elements as nodes and the lines that connect them
as edges .
The top node of the tree is called the ROOT node
we refer to the children as leaf nodes

BINARY TREE
A binary tree is a tree data structure in which each node
has at most two children

BINARY SEARCH TREE

          7
        /   \
      4       9
    /   \    /  \
   1     6  8    10

It is a special type of BINARY TREE , it allows us to quickly
look for data .
special condition:
left child < node < right child
unlike Arrays or LinkedList we don't have to traverse this whole
tree to find a value.

Let's Say we are looking for 1 we start with the root node
is 1 smaller or larger than the value of root node? it's smaller!
So we look at the left sub-tree we don't care about the right
sub-tree because we know all these nodes are greater than 7
we are narrowing down our search .
this tree has 7 nodes but we found our target node with
only 3 comparisons , Because in every step we threw half of
our nodes away this is what we call LOGARITHMIC TIME COMPLEXITY

LOOKUP : O(log n)
INSERT : O(log n)
DELETE : O(log n)

Q) Add the following numbers to a binary search tree. Remember,
in a binary search tree:
left < parent
right > parent
[10, 5, 15, 6, 1, 8, 12, 18, 17]

                   10
                /      \
              5          15
           /   \        /   \
         1       6     12    18
                   \        /
                     8    17
