/*1-
Implement two stacks in one array. Support these operations:
push1() // to push in the first stack
push2() // to push in the second stack
pop1()
pop2()
isEmpty1()
isEmpty2()
isFull1()
isFull2()
Make sure your implementation is space efficient. (hint: do not allocate
the same amount of space by dividing the array in half.)
