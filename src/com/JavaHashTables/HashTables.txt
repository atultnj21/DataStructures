Hash tables are also known as dictionaries.
•spell checkers
•dictionaries
•compilers
•code editors

name in different languages
• java -> HashMap
• JavaScript -> Object
• python ->  Dictionary
• C# -> dictionary

these are able to store-key value pairs
ex:-employeeNumber employeeName

hash function is deterministic.
every time we give it the same inout it will return us the same value
that is why we can use it for storing and retrieving objects.
internally a hash table uses an array to store our objects.

Operations
• insert o(1)
• lookup o(1)
• delete o(1)

the Interface Map<K,V>

type parameters:
K - the type of keys maintained by this map
V - the type of mapped values

Mostly used
HashMap

 Hash Map basically maps a key to a value
 we have another data structure called SET and sets only
 have keys they don't have values, Sets just like Maps
 don't allow duplicate keys.

so lets say we have a list of numbers and in this list
we have duplicates now we want to remove these duplicates
all we have to do is to get each item and add it to the set
because sets don't allow duplicates we will end up with a unique
list of values . so that's one of the application of sets.

Mostly used:
HashSet

Hash Table gets the Key,Based on this it figures out
where to store this value in the memory , technically
we store these values in an array , so in more accurate
terms hash table maps this key to an index value the
index at which we should store this value. this is then
job of a hash function that gets a value and maps it to
a different kind of value which we call a hash value/hash code
or just hash in context of data structure hash function
a key value to an index value.
