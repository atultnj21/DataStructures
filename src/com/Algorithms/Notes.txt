• Bubble sort

   Best case scenario
   Passes O(1)
   comparisons O(n)
   total : O(n) Liner

   Worst case scenario
   Passes O(n)
   comparisons O(n)
   total : O(n^2)

• Selection Sort

   Best case scenario
   Passes O(n)
   comparisons O(n)
   total : O(n^2) Quadratic

   Worst case scenario
   Passes O(n)
   comparisons O(n)
   total : O(n^2) Quadratic

   selecting the minimum element

• Insertion Sort

   Best case scenario
   iterations O(n)
   shift items O(1)
   total : O(n) Linear

   Worst case scenario
   iterations O(n)
   shift items O(n)
   total : O(n^2) Quadratic

• Merge Sort (DIVIDE AND CONQUER ALGORITHM)

  The idea of merge sort is to break down the list
  into smaller and smaller sublist sort those and
  merge them back to a complete sorted list we Start
  of by dividing the array into half we can find the
  middle element by dividing the length of the array
  by 2 . we are allocating additional space for this
  algorithm to run We Will Keep On dividing the  list
  into the sublist until we get the sublist having one
  element only after that we will merge the sublist
  and we will keep on merging the sublist to produce
  a new sorted list

               BEST          WORST

   Dividing    O(log n)      O(log n)
   Merging     O(n)          O(n)

     total    O(n log n)    O(n log n)
     space    O(n)          O(n)

• QuickSort
    implemented by selecting first element as pivot
