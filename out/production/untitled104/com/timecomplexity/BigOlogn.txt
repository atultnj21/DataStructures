An algorithm that runs in logarithmic time is more efficient
and more scalable that a algorithm that runs in linear or
quadratic time.

ex:
let's say we have an array of sorted numbers 1-10
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
and we want to find the number 10
one way to find 10 is to iterate over this array with the
help of for-loop going forward until we find 10 this
is called the linear search because it runs in linear time

we have another searching algorithm called binary search
this algorithm runs in logarithmic time, assuming that our array
is sorted we start off by looking at the middle item,is this item
smaller or greater than the value we are looking for its smaller
so our number must be on the right partition of the array
now in the right partition we again look at the middle item
it smaller so again we ignore the items in the left and focus
on the items on the right.
