Arrays are our very first data structure
we use them to store a ist of items sequentially

Lookup O(1).

arrays are static -> this means when  we allocate them
we should specify their size

resize

10  20  30  40  50

10  20  30  40  50  60

O(n)

removing an item

Last item - O(1)

beginning - O(n) ->worst case -> we have to shift all the
items on the right one step to the left.
