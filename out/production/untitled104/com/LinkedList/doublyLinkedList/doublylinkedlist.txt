Doubly Linked List
------------------
doubly linked list is similar to singly linked list
In addition each node have a reference to the previous
node

Singly Linked List
DELETION From the end O(n)

Doubly Linked List
DELETION From the end O(1)

each node will have an extra field that holds the address of
the previous node

Both doubly linked list and singly linked list can be circular
i.e. the last node will reference to the first node
