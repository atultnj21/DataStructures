we use linked list to store a list of objects in
sequence,unlike arrays linked list can grow and
shrink Automatically.
Linked lists consist of a group of nodes in sequence
each node holds two pieces of data one is value
other is the address of the next node in the list.
* Each node points to the next node *
we call the first node as head and the last node as
tail.
INSERTION from Beginning/end- O(1)
INSERTION from middle - O(n)

DELETION from beginning - O(1)

DELETION from end -O(n)
we can get to tail but we cannot get back to the
previous element using tail in singly linked list

DELETION FROM MIDDLE- O(n)
