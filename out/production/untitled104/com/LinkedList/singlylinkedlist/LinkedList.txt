we use linked list to store a list of objects in
sequence,unlike arrays linked list can grow and
shrink Automatically.
Linked lists consist of a group of nodes in sequence
each node holds two pieces of data one is value
other is the address of the next node in the list.
* Each node points to the next node *
we call the first node as head and the last node as
tail.
INSERTION from Beginning/end- O(1)
INSERTION from middle - O(n)

DELETION from beginning - O(1)

DELETION from end -O(n)
we can get to tail but we cannot get back to the
previous element using tail in singly linked list

DELETION FROM MIDDLE- O(n)

Difference Between Arrays and Linked List
-----------------------------------------
SPACE
static arrays have a fixed size
dynamic arrays grow by 50-100%
Linked lists don't  waste memory
Use arrays if you know the number of items to store

Arrays
Lookup
   by index O(1)
   by value O(n)
Insert
   beginning/end O(n)
   middle        O(n)
Delete
   beginning     O(n)
   middle        O(n)
   end           O(n)

Linked list
Lookup
   by index O(n)
   by value O(n)
Insert
   beginning/end O(1)
   middle        O(n)
Delete
   beginning     O(1)
   middle        O(n)
   end           O(n)
