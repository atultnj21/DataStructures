Doubly Linked List
------------------
doubly linked list is similar to singly linked list
In addition each node have a reference to the previous
node

Singly Linked List
DELETION From the end O(n)

Doubly Linked List
DELETION From the end O(1)

each node will have an extra field that holds the address of
the previous node

One of the limitations of the singly linked list is that it can
be traversed in only one direction that is forward. The doubly
linked list has overcome this limitation by providing an additional
pointer that points to the previous node. With the help of the
previous pointer, the doubly linked list can be traversed in a
backward direction thus making insertion and deletion operation
easier to perform.

Both doubly linked list and singly linked list can be circular
i.e. the last node will reference to the first node
